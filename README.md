social_api
===================

This library provides access to REST-api for several social networks.
Just now it is only 3 popular russian networks. More may come later.

===================

TODO:

* Remove hand-made logging. Right now it suits my needs, but it may annoy another users, if they appear.
* Use pool of keep-alive connections
* Limit simultaneous connections.
* Limit requests per second.
